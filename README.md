Millions of students have a learning, physical, or visual disability that prevents a person from reading conventional print. The majority of educational materials for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are inaccessible to these students. Technology that makes the written word accessible exists. However, doing so for educational visuals like graphs remains complex and resource intensive. As a result, only a small fraction of educational materials are available for learners with this learning difference â€”unless machine learning could help bridge that gap.

The goal of this competition is to extract data represented by four types of charts commonly found in STEM textbooks. You will develop an automatic solution trained on a graph dataset.
